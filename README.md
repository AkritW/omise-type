# Omise.js type
Third-party Omise.js TypeScript's typings support.

## Why
![Confused Fox](https://image.myanimelist.net/ui/ZPVPz_CObDpnH08hnJF81OfXLbu4yKz7EE0wsUNM1bM-5Fg4fBn2OXfgMSDKKKINYC3JrVKqokAsQONKiC12qcyHJdcV3YS6qn8KH_dwLXL0stNYPfBtpsLkJOZ61Nu_)

Omise.js force web developer to use CDN only which is like an anti-pattern and cause a lot of problems, one of it is lack of TypeScript supports.

Since Omise doesn't supports TypeScript, developers have to do it themself.

This repo is source code for third-party Omise.js TypeScript's typings for web developer who use TypeScript.

## Getting Start
1. Install using npm or yarn
```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/omise-js

yarn add --dev @types/omise-js
```

2. Done

## Usage
Calling `window.Omise` and `windows.OmiseForm` will now have type supports.

## Contribution
All contributions, PRs and discussions are all welcomed.

## To Omise
By chance, if you're reading please know that next time please provide better developer experience.

I'm going to be honest, I'm quite disappointed seeing how Omise lack of supports for developer (at-least web dev) by the time I was writing. (6 Jan 2021)

Omise looks great to get start at first, but seeing how lack of supports for developers is, I would rather pick other alternative provide much better eg. Stripe if I don't have to support Thai people.

I saw some devs trying to open issue for a year for TypeScript supports, NPM and stuff. Most of of it's not accepted, some is left to rot.

I'm quite rooting for Thai tech startup to go for world-class, yet lacking for supports like this is a pain for customers, if you're going to take-over this repo, I'm more than happy to giving it right-away seeing that at-least you care more about developers.

Please do it better next time, Omise.
